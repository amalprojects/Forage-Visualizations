# Visualizations
This repository contains some experimental visualization activities using Power BI and python done in my free time.

# Accenture Forage Virtual Experience Program

# Understanding the business problem

Case study involving a social media start up which has been experiencing a sudden surge in popularity and wishes to capitalize on this opportunity by understanding its customers better. The task here is to answer specific business questions such as the most popular or top 5 content categories on the platform. 

# Data Cleaning

First step involved selecting the appropriate data sets which will help us to answer the question. 3 data sets were chosen which contained the necessary information.
The datasets had some initial problems such as null values and non uniform words with some special characters and case sensitivity issues.

Next step was to use python to clean the data and remove the faults, mentioned above, in the dataset to get a more usable dataset.

# Data Modelling

Using python, we join the three datasets together to get the final dataset . The final data set contains information such as content category (such as animals,technology,food.. etc) , reactions(happy, excited , disgusted.. etc) and score of each reaction. 

# Data Visualisation

Now its time to convert the dataset into a csv file and import it into Power BI. The visualizations done in power BI tell us that the animals category is the most popular and watched category among others. The month of May is the busiest in terms of online traffic for the company. Most content uploads are in the form of photos.
And overall sentiment of the users towards the content is on the positive side with only 30% negative reactions.

Pdf of visualisation is provided in the repo. Code is provided in the "Data Projects" repo.
