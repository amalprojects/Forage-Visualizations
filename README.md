# Visualizations
This repository contains some experimental visualization activities using Power BI and python done in my free time.

The visualization below is of the Accenture virtual experience program on forage. The data cleaning and analysis is in the "data-projects" repository. I have pasted the final visualization below incase you dont have Power BI installed.
